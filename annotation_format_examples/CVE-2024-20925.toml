# WIP
# CVE-2024-20925
#
# Vulnerability in the Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition product of Oracle Java SE (component: JavaFX). 
# Supported versions that are affected are Oracle Java SE: 8u391; Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition: 20.3.12 and 21.3.8. 
# Difficult to exploit vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise 
# Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition. Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than 
# the attacker. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some 
# of Oracle Java SE, Oracle GraalVM Enterprise Edition accessible data. Note: This vulnerability applies to Java deployments, 
# typically in clients running sandboxed Java Web Start applications or sandboxed Java applets, that load and run untrusted 
# code (e.g., code that comes from the internet) and rely on the Java sandbox for security. This vulnerability does not apply 
# to Java deployments, typically in servers, that load and run only trusted code (e.g., code installed by an administrator). 
# CVSS 3.1 Base Score 3.1 (Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N).
#
# https://whichjdk.com/ does a decent job of summarizing the current java support matrix as well as the most prominent 
# current and past re-distributions of OpenJDK
#
# CVE-2024-20925 specifically affects the "javafx/media" component of OpenJFX per OpenJDK announcement at https://openjdk.org/groups/vulnerability/advisories/2024-01-16
#
# Per further investigation, CVE-2024-20925 seems to correspond to JDK-8313105 (see: https://github.com/bmwiedemann/openSUSE/blob/5d8d39bcbcb271dd86a38ab4df05f4da97327374/packages/o/openjfx/openjfx.changes#L12)
#
# That then corresponds to the following commits:
# - https://github.com/openjdk/jfx17u/commit/18206453163dec04f36f8787ce73624bb9ba6a7d 
# - https://github.com/openjdk/jfx21u/commit/0c00753da13ed696b1a5025ce01ff478ee7ebd0a
# - https://github.com/openjdk/jfx/commit/0a52a4cf1d1226e7a3c6d73313fde02e7f36fb11
# 
# It is unclear where the commit for fixing the 8.x release line is
#
# It seems that prior to Java 11, JavaFX was included in OpenJDK, but afterwards was refactored into a separate project OpenJFX with the code at https://github.com/openjdk/jfx.  See the following extract from the Amazon Correto FAQS: 
#
# From https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/faqs/:
# Q: Is JavaFX included with Corretto? If so, which versions of Corretto have it bundled?
#
# Before OpenJDK 11, JavaFX was included in OpenJDK. However, in 2018, Oracle decoupled JavaFX from OpenJDK, removing it from OpenJDK distributions. Corretto 8 does include JavaFX for the following platforms:
#
# AL2 x64
# Generic Linux x64
# Windows x86 JDK
# Windows x64 JDK
# Windows x86 JRE
# Windows x64 JRE
#
# We do not include it on other platforms, regardless of version. For example, JavaFX is not supported in Corretto 8 for Mac M1.
# We recommend that you upgrade to Corretto 17+, preferably Corretto 17, since this release will have more up-to-date code and generally perform better than its predecessors. In some instances you may wish to be on the latest JDK, which could be a short term support release with near EOL date. You can find and download the JFX releases from the JavaFX website.
#
#
# Amazon Corretto 8 fixed at Implementation version 8.402.07.1 (need the openjdk version though) per changelog at https://github.com/corretto/corretto-8/blob/2b0d156988533c56a3050bc17d15650d6308873d/CHANGELOG.md?plain=1#L52C37-L52C47

# 
# OpenJFX can be installed in several ways per https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
# The JavaFX runtime is available as a platform-specific SDK, as a number of jmods, and as a set of artifacts in maven central
# The jfx maven component corresponding to this particular vuln: https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.openjfx/javafx-media
# 
# Azul provides a CVE source for their Azul Zulu builds at https://docs.azul.com/core/cve which can be helpful in determining which 
# OpenJDK release contained a particular "fix".  It also contains the specific implementer version which is needed for enumerating
# the affected ranges on their .apk, .deb, and .rpm based installs used in their official images.
#
# For OpenJDK prior to version 9, the version number had a 1 in the major version (Proposal for dropping the 1 from major version https://openjdk.org/jeps/223)
# There are inconsistencies in how the pre-v9 versions are represented, which is particularly important since v8 is still supported.  For now we should include both a 1.8.x_{} 
# number and and 8.x.+{} type range so that consumers should be able to match relevant ranges regardless of which represention is used
