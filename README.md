# Vulnerability Data Tools

This is a project that's meant to help enrich vulnerability data. The project was created due to the uncertain nature of NVD. There are currently two repos. This repo to host the tooling needed to parse vulnerability data. We will also use this repo for discussions and planning.

Please feel free to browse the current issues and submit new ones with ideas and questions. There is also a public Slack channel that can be used for questions and comments [#vulnerability-data-project](https://anchorecommunity.slack.com/archives/C06Q9UTQD2L).

The output of these tools is the [nvd-data-overrides](https://github.com/anchore/nvd-data-overrides) project. This repo specifically holds override data in the NVD format. This repo should only hold data, no planning or discussion should happen here.

The NVD Data Overrides repo hosts a [FAQ](https://github.com/anchore/nvd-data-overrides?tab=readme-ov-file#faq) that answers some of the questions about how this project will work now and in the future. The FAQ is very specific to NVD, while this repo will be more broad than just NVD.

## Project layout
