# NVD mapping scripts

The purpose of these scripts is to map the data in the cve5 data into something that looks like NVD CPE data. We are focusing only on CPE data at the moment.

Long term we will try to store the data in a non CPE format that is friendlier to humans. A more comprehensive format will also allow transforming it into other outputs, such as OSV.

## How to setup the scripts

Clone these repos
- https://github.com/westonsteimel/cvelist-v5/
- https://github.com/westonsteimel/national-vulnerability-database
- https://github.com/anchore/nvd-data-overrides/

Then create symlinks to them in this (nvd) directory

If you run
```
python -m scripts.nvd_override_candidates_from_cve5
```

It will update the data in the nvd-data-overrides repository. The updated data needs to be inspected by humans.
